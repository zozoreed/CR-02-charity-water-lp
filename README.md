# Week 2 Project: Build the charity: water Landing Page
To get started, create a new Codespace from this repo.

In this Project, you’ll transform your Canva mockup into a fully functional landing page using HTML and CSS. This is your chance to take your creative concept — with your brand visuals, your messaging, and your imagery — and make it real. You'll build a site that not only looks great, but also educates, inspires, and drives action.

With help from AI to jumpstart your layout, you'll focus on structuring your content, applying your brand style, and creating a polished final product that reflects your vision. By the end of this Project, you’ll have a live, interactive page deployed to the web. You can share this work when you want to showcase your technical skills and your passion for digital storytelling.
